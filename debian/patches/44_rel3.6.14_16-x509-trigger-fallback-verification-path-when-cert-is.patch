Subject: [PATCH 2/3] x509: trigger fallback verification path when cert is
 expired

gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2 use the macro SIGNER_OLD_OR_UNKNOWN
to trigger the fallback verification path if the signer of the last
certificate is not in the trust store.  Previously, it doesn't take
into account of the condition where the certificate is expired.
